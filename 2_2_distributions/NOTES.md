- What did you have trouble solving?

First, it took me a while to find a good data set, and to get into a 'groove' with this. I am stretched too thin this semester and it's hard to carve out the time to play around and code when I have so many things demanding my attention.

I haven't had to analyze or clean a data set in a long time (most of my current work is qualitative and conceptual), so it was rusty once I did get into it. I ended up simplifying a data set from Statista after initially wanting to use the DHS census report. Perhaps my initial aspirtations were far too grand.

Technically, it took me a while to make the axis ranges look good. I tried to add a filter to bold the text of the year that had the greatest count, but couldn't quite get there.

- What went easier than expected?

Some of the work on these visualizations reminded me of working in the GGPlot2 package in R, though the coding was quite different. So I had some sort of a mental model for graphs and these kinds of charts, and for doing it with 

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
