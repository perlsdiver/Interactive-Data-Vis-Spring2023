## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?

I had a hard time getting started, and feeling confident in my output.

- What went easier than expected?

Once I got into it, the task of rearranging the x and y axis orientation was not super difficult to figure out.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Frustration and anxiety about time and deadlines.

I could not figure out how to fix the axis labels and get them to display. I feel it's fixable if I had a bit more time to tinker with the code and adapt code that I made work for 2_2 and 2_3.


Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
