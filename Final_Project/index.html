      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>This website asks you, the viewer, to explore an interactive map of New York City. It invites you to imagine maps such as 
        this as tools of urban governance. By governance I mean administration, management, and a general approach to the operation
        of government (see more on Foucault and Rose for this). Information visualization is a practice central to administration of 
        public data; visualizations render information into representations that can trigger action. It is thus important to consider how
        and in what ways visualizations create impetus for action (or inaction).
      </p>
      <p>The map you will explore in the next tab ("Visualizations") depicts data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, particularly
        data on plumbing facilities, using the D3.JS library. Under the Housing Characteristics section of the survey, it reports whether a building has
        adequate or inadequate plumbing facilities. This is sorted into owner-occupied and renter-occupied, and the available data is
        organized at the level of Census tract. (ADD MORE ON TRACTS)
      </p>
      <p>Plumbing is an interesting question to look at because it is an aspect of "housing" that is often presumed or taken for granted. An article 
        <a href = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/27/water-almost-half-million-us-households-lack-indoor-plumbing>published in The Guardian in 2021</a>
         described the phenomenon of "plumbing poverty" in the United States, where nearly half a million households lack adequate indoor plumbing. Although 
         plumbing poverty has decreased in New York City, it is still significant. It is also a point of intersection between the built environment, housing, government 
         administration, and social services. It can indicate a point at which "housing" is not adequate for modern standards, which could trigger administrative action 
         such as building code inspections, child welfare investigations, or social service outreach, such as Adult Protective Services. 
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/159767495/Plumbing_Poverty_in_US_Cities.pdf>a 2021 report by The Plumbing Poverty Project</a>, 
        in New York City alone, 65,000 residents are estimated to not have access to piped water. As you explore the map, consider this, and what it might mean for 
        people in New York. See the bar chart below for summary representation of this data in a bar chart. You can click on the buttons to toggle between owner-occupied 
        and renter-occupied housing units.

      <h3>Map</h3>
      <p>The following map allows you to explore a visual representation of NYC. It draws from Census data, organized by tract, that
        indicates if an occupied building has adequate or inadequate plumbing. It is sorted into two possible maps - one marking
        owner-occupied buidlings, and one marking renter-occupied buildings.</p>
