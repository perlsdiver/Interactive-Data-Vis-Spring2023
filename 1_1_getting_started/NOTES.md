## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?

It took me a moment to get oriented and figure out the interface of doing it all. I have trouble with translating instructions to mental models and tend to need to learn through repeated process exposure (and often, through things failing/debugging).
- What went easier than expected?
Getting back into some of the basic flow of writing code. It's been a little while.
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
