## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
I am not sure if I was suppose to integrate all of the components. The <path> element of SVG was confusing, though I was able to take some code and make it work without errors.

I also could not figure out how to assign class test data to particular table rows. For example, for this section the class did not appear to have any effect (so I removed it from the final code).

   <tr class="strikeout">
      <td>Participatory Democracy and Social Movements</td>
      <td>Tuesday</td>
      <td>2:00 PM</td>
      <td>Every Spring semester</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Dropped</td>
      <td>Very interesting topic; PhD cohort peer is also taking; not as
        relevant to immediate skills or knowledge needs. I may pop in for some sessions. Can take next year.</td>
    </tr>

- What went easier than expected?

Figuring out how to assemble the table data.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Mostly just finding the time to sit with the code and play around; I am very busy and easily distacted when I do try. I also feel a bit like this is still disconnected from my other ongoing learning.

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
