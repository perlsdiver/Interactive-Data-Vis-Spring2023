## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.

- What did you have trouble solving?

I found Javascript a bit more complex, and it took me a while to make sense of how to write the script for counting clicks.

I got stuck on replicating the sample code for the name popup, and building from the exercises we did in class. In doing this, I got distracted from the main goal of this exercise, which was quite simple, and subquently lost time.

- What went easier than expected?

Some of the basic HTML aspects seemed easier, with practice.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Lack of ongoing exposure and people in my life to talk to about the work to acclimate my mental models to computational thinking. I feel some pressure from moving the deadline a week up. I am a social learner, so Google searches and various websites are only so helpful (and only able to hold my attention for so long).

Some of it is myself and how I work/think with novel problems -  When I get frustrated, I either get overwhelmed by the amount of information in front of me (and then don't really know where to start) or I become hyper focused on trying to fix something when I should walk away. I can lose sight of what the actual assignment or goal is.

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
